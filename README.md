## A first attempt at classifying Northern Cardinal song repertoires

This repository will hold a clone of [ANIMAL-SPOT](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y), ARU recordings, and training data. The objective is to detect and classify the vocal repertoires of individual Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) recorded on territories at Rice Creek Field Station and Barry Park by Dr. Daniel Baldassarre and Brooke Goldman (SUNY Oswego).
